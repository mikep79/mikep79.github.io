            <h4>Contracted Musician and Music Teacher – Twin Cities
                <p><i>2008-current</i></p>
                <p>Currently, I teach guitar and voice lessons privately and for All Things Music, LLC. My responsibilities include teaching 30 to 45 minute individual lessons, developing lessons tailored to each student's ability, and preparing music that engages students' interest. I emphasize developing a well-rounded comprehension and playing ability by teaching note reading, music theory, learning tunes by ear, efficient technique, and comfort in performing. I am also employed as a choir section leader at St. Stephen Lutheran Church, where I lead sectional rehearsals and help develop vocal ability in adult singers.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I perform professionally as a freelance musician and singer, both as a solo artist, and in ensembles. I am particularly active in local classical music groups, including the Minnesota Chorale, Consortium Carissimi, The Singers, Hymnos, Chorus Polaris, Lute Café, and others. I also work as a church musician at St. Stephen Lutheran Church. I have recorded one album of solo guitar music, and have performed on four commercial albums, including three for Naxos Records with Consortium Carissimi.</p>
