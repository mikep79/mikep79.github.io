            <h3>Recent Work Experience:</h3>
            <p><b>Contracted Musician and Music Teacher </b>– Twin Cities</p>
            <p><i><ul>2008-current</i></ul></p>
            <p>Currently, I teach guitar and voice lessons privately and for All Things Music, LLC. My 
            responsibilities include teaching 30 to 45 minute individual lessons, developing lessons 
            tailored to each student's ability, and preparing music that engages students' interest. I 
            emphasize developing a well-rounded comprehension and playing ability by teaching note 
            reading, music theory, learning tunes by ear, efficient technique, and comfort in performing. 
            I am also employed as a choir section leader at St. Stephen Lutheran Church, where I lead 
            sectional rehearsals and help develop vocal ability in adult singers.</p>
            <p>I perform professionally as a freelance musician and singer, both as a solo artist, and in 
            ensembles. I am particularly active in local classical music groups, including the Minnesota 
            rale, Consortium Carissimi, The Singers, Hymnos, Chorus Polaris, Lute Café, and others. I also 
            work as a church musician at St. Stephen Lutheran Church. I have recorded one album of solo 
            guitar music, and have performed on four commercial albums, including three for Naxos Records 
            with Consortium Carissimi.</p>

            <p><i><ul>2013-2016</i></ul></p>
            <p>Working at numerous libraries throughout Hennepin County, I served the public by assisting 
                with library cards and materials, information requests, and technology resources. I also 
                processed materials requested and returned to the library. Accomplishments include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Serving on the Circulation Services Committee.</li>
                <li>Developing training documents for circulation tools.</li>
